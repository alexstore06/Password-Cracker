Password Cracker - Proof of Concept
Copyright 2020 Alex Weir. All Rights Reserved.

Guesses a string that you enter, while counting iterations, iterations per second, and keyspace percentage used.
Checkboxes are used for charset customization. Length of string entered will be used to guess password. This may be changed in a future major update.
Keyspace percentage used may be over 100%, because strings already tried may be randomly tried again.
